# NIMA-Score-Aesthetics

This repository contains a Jupyter Notebook that allows you to perform inference on your own images using the NIMA (Neural Image Assessment) model from Idealo.

## Overview
The NIMA model, developed by Idealo, predicts the aesthetic and technical quality of images. This project provides a streamlined way to use the NIMA model to score your own images for aesthetic quality.

## Features
- Load and preprocess images.
- Perform inference using a pre-trained NIMA model.
- Output aesthetic scores for your images.
